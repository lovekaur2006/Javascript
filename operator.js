//Operators in JS
//1. Arithmetic operators
let a = 3;
let b = 5;
console.log("The sum of a and b is " + (a + b));
console.log("The difference of a and b is " + (a - b));
console.log("The multiplication of a and b is " + (a * b));
console.log("The division of a and b is " + (a / b));
console.log("The modulus of a and b is " + (a % b));

//Assignment operators
let y = 7;
// y += 7;
// y -= 7;
// y *= 7;
y /= 7;
console.log(y);

//comparison operators
let c = 9;
let d = 8;
console.log(a == b);
console.log(a != b);
console.log(a < b);
console.log(a > b);
console.log(a <= b);
console.log(a >= b);

//Logical operators
let e = 4;
let f = 7;
console.log((e == f) && (e >= f));
console.log((e == f) || (e >= f));
console.log(!(e == f));

//Bitwise operator
let g = 5;
let h = 1;
console.log(g & h);
console.log(g | h);
console.log(~g);
console.log(g ^ h);
console.log(g << h);
console.log(g >> h);
